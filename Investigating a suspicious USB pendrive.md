## Investigating a suspicious USB pendrive found at a crime scene. The forensic team needs to acquire evidence from the pendrive while ensuring the integrity of the data. Using the dd and dc3dd commands, create a forensic image (.img) file of the pendrive. Additionally, generate a SHA-256 hashfile for the image file to verify its integrity. Finally, wipe the pendrive using the disk wipe pattern 00011 to prevent any potential data leakage. 

> **Run the commands and take a snapshot and submit it in a word document**
